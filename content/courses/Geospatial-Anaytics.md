  ## Summary


  This course will focus on how to explore, analyze, and visualize geospatial
  data. Using Python and ArcGIS Pro, we will inspect and manipulate geospatial
  data, we will use powerful GIS tools to analyze spatial relationships, link
  tabular data with spatial data, and map the data. Interactive activities
  throughout the course will provide hands-on experience to cement learning. In
  these activities, participants will use Python and the arcpy library to invoke
  key GIS tools for spatial analysis and mapping. The course will provide
  participants with core programming skills for harnessing GIS data.


  Geographic data is ubiquitous and the ability to analyze and visualize
  geospatial aspects of a problem can contribute valuable insights. Everything
  happens somewhere and location matters. Familiarity with GIS data formats and
  GIS capabilities and the ability to automate the analysis of GIS datasets is
  beneficial in a broad spectrum of government and industry positions, as well
  as academic fields.


  ## Core Topics


  The course will introduce geospatial data formats and data projection and the
  capabilities of geographic information systems (GIS). Then students will learn
  the use of Python for each of the following:


  * Invoke GIS tools
    * Project data
    * Perform proximity analysis
    * Select features based on location or data attributes
    * Join tabular data with spatial data
    * Calculate fields from geometries
    * Perform density analysis
    * Calculate spatial statistics
    * Compute map algebra
  * Batch geoprocessing
    * List GIS datasets in a workspace
    * Batch process the dataset
    * List the fields in a GIS dataset
    * Access the field properties
  * Read and modify GIS tables with cursors

  * Map GIS data and export maps

  * Additional topics (if time permits)
    * Mapping in 3D scene view
    * arcpy Charts
    * ArcGIS deep learning tools
prereqs: >
  You will need a computer during class and an installation of ArcGIS Pro. This
  course is best suited for those who already have a basic working knowledge of
  Python. Students with no knowledge of Python should consider taking an
  introductory Python short course. One option could be the Monday-Tuesday
  “Introduction to Programming in Python”. Students who do not already have
  access to ArcGIS Pro will need to install the free trial prior to class.
  Additional instructions for testing the installation will be provided in
  advance of the course.
