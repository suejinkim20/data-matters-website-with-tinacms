  ## Summary


  Learning Python is important for any aspiring data scientist who is interested
  in programming as a skill, a discipline, and a profession. For those students
  attending the Introduction to Python class on Monday and Tuesday, we will
  continue working with hands-on programming and managing large and complex
  datasets.


  This course moves beyond the introductory concepts presented in the two-day
  course, “Introduction to Programming in Python” (offered on Monday-Tuesday)
  and presents more programming-focused content with data applications. Students
  will get hands-on practice with creating and manipulating data sets,
  performing error handling, and storing and retrieving data using relational
  databases.


  ## Core Topics


  Students will learn how to:


  * create programs that manipulate data

  * perform error handling

  * store and retrieve data using relational databases

  * use the pandas library, the de facto standard to work with tabular data in
  Python
prereqs: >
  An introductory knowledge of Python is required. You will need to also be
  skilled in basic mathematics and algebra as well as e-mail and Web usage.
  Please bring a laptop to the course.
