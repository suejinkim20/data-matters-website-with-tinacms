title: Deep Learning in Python
slug: deep-learning-in-python
description: >
  ## Summary


  In the past few years, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful machine
  learning method that has found applications in areas such as object
  recognition, image classification, video analysis, and natural language
  processing. This course will discuss where and how deep learning is used and
  how to get people to use it. The approach will be to minimize the math and
  concentrate instead on the underlying ideas and principles. We will
  concentrate on Tensorflow/Keras as the underlying computational platforms and
  use Python to create the DL codes. Much of the course will be driven by a
  number of hands-on exercises that will help you build simple networks in
  Keras/Tensorflow. These exercises will cover analysis of tabular data, images,
  videos, and text. At the end of the course you will have a basic understanding
  of DL, Tensorflow/Keras as a DL platform, and example applications.


  Deep Learning appears to be a magical algorithm that can solve difficult
  problems in a variety of domains. The coming together of a number of trends
  underlie the success of DL. In this course, you will get a chance to look
  under the hood of the DL hype and see the underlying architectures, and you
  will be exposed to a set of tools that you can use to create your own deep
  learning models.


  ## Core Topics


  The course will focus on the following topics:


  * Neural networks

  * Deep neural networks

  * Training of deep neural networks

  * Tensors, Tensorflow and Keras

  * Convolutional neural networks

  * Transformers

  * Autoencoders

  * Generative adversarial networks

  * Transfer learning

  * Text as data


  Participants will complete a number of computer exercises using Python and 
  Keras/Tensorflow.
prereqs: >
  This course will assume an understanding of statistics and calculus at the
  undergraduate level and programming experience with Python to get full
  benefits from the class.
