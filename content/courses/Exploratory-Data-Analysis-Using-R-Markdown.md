title: Exploratory Data Analysis Using R Markdown
slug: exploratory-data-analysis-with-r-markdown
description: >
  ## Summary


  This course introduces techniques for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)—both
  numeric and graphical—to help provide insight into data sets. Using R and
  RStudio, we will demonstrate various tools to generate data summaries and
  introduce R Markdown for generating HTML output. Incorporating R Markdown
  allows for the generation of output which includes results from statistical
  analysis, plots, figures (such as diagrams), and explanations of any output.


  Reading and writing data are only part of the analysis process. Analysis and
  documentation of results remain a cornerstone of the statistics and data
  science practices. In this course, methods for basic statistical analysis
  allow participants the opportunity to analyze data in a familiar way while
  developing R Markdown skills for creating files with a seamless integration of
  code and results along with a narrative explaining those methods and their
  output.


  By presenting the process in terms of familiar statistics concepts,
  participants can substitute any statistical analysis from their toolbox to
  produce reports that match the required sophistication level for any analysis.


  ## Core Topics


  Covering both general computing concepts and an introduction to R, a tentative
  outline of the course is given below:


  * Numeric data summaries

  * Graphical data summaries (ggplot2 package)

  * Creating high-quality graphics (ggplot2 package)

  * R markdown for professional documentation/reproducibility
prereqs: >
  This course assumes a working knowledge of computers and some prior experience
  in R is required. At a minimum, knowledge about data objects, an understanding
  of R syntax, and experience with the tidyverse collection of packages are
  strongly recommended.


  This course relies on active participation of the participants via hands-on
  programming. R and RStudio should be installed in advance so that participants
  can devote their time to practicing the skills from the course. Participants
  will be provided instructions and resources in advance to assist with the
  installation process.
