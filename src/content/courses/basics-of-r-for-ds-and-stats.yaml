title: Basics of R for Data Science and Statistics
description: >
  ## Summary
  
  This course introduces the use of the popular R statistical programming
  language for conducting and sharing your data science projects. R is a mature
  and vibrant programming language, and one of the major platforms for doing
  data science.  This course covers how to use RStudio effectively, frequently
  used data structures, importing data, common data manipulations, summary
  statistics, data visualizations, and basic regression modeling through the
  suite of packages called the “tidyverse.” 

  R is an extremely versatile programming language that has the capability to
  fit a fantastic array of statistical and machine learning models. It is
  open-source, free, and gives you the ability to easily and widely share your
  analyses. The “tidyverse” offers an ecosystem of tools that help you harness
  R’s versatility and power, allowing you to easily import data, wrangle it,
  and use statistics to gain insights from it. In turn, RStudio offers a
  one-stop-shop development environment for your data analysis projects. By
  introducing you to some of the most useful features of RStudio and the
  tidyverse, this course will help you build a solid foundation in the use of R
  to complete the common tasks associated with a typical data science pipeline.

  ## Core Topics

  The course provides a modern introduction to using R for data science through
  the extremely popular suite of packages called the “tidyverse.”  More
  specifically, the course will cover: 

    - Day 1:
      + Working with the RStudio IDE
      + R object types and data storage
      + Reading data from common formats into R
      + Piping multiple operations
      + Common data manipulations and reshaping
    - Day 2:
      + Numerical data summaries
      + Graphical exploratory data analysis
      + Basic regression and classification models 
      + Sharing your work in reproducible ways using RMarkdown

prereqs: This course will make heavy use of hands-on programming in R. Thus,
  some prior familiarity with the basics of the R language is required. We will
  generally introduce a topic and then have hands-on exercises to practice and
  explore that topic.  Participants must have access to the internet and the
  ability to install programs and download files.  This course assumes a strong
  working knowledge of computers and, although not required, it would be
  beneficial to have past experience with the logic of programming and/or
  conducting statistical analyses. Participants are provided instructions and
  resources in advance to assist with installing R, RStudio, and the tidyverse.
